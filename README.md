## Overview
### folders.css
This snippet provides custom colors for folders in the file explorer based on their prefix. Each folder prefix (e.g., 00, 10, 20) gets a unique color scheme, including the folder title, indentation guides, and collapse icons.

### headings.css
This snippet provides custom colors for headings (H1-H6).

## Installation

2. Create a folder named snippets if it doesn't already exist inside your .obsidian directory (e.g., YourVault/.obsidian/snippets/).

3. Copy the .css files (folders.css, headings.css) into this snippets folder.

4. Open Obsidian, go to Settings > Appearance.

5. Scroll down to the CSS snippets section and toggle on the snippets you wish to enable.
