## Overview
### folders.css
This snippet provides custom colors for folders in the file explorer based on their prefix. Each folder prefix (e.g., 00, 10, 20) gets a unique color scheme, including the folder title, indentation guides, and collapse icons.

### headings.css
This snippet provides custom colors for headings (H1-H6).

## Installation

4. Open Obsidian, go to Settings > Appearance.

5. Scroll down to the CSS snippets section and toggle on the snippets you wish to enable.
